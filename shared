1. Create a new directory, named how you like. In the example below it is
within your home directory.
mkdir /home/n869p538/directoryname
2. Grant yourself user ownership of the directory, and Ahmni's group
(a467p218_g) group ownership.
sudo chown n869p538:a467p218_g /home/n869p538/directoryname
3. Change permissions so that the group owner has write and execute access to
the directory, and set the setgid sticky bit so that group ownership persists.
sudo chmod g+wxs /home/n869p538/directoryname
4. Grant "others" execute rights to /home/n869p538 so that Ahmni can enter that
directory
sudo chmod o+x /home/n869p538
5. You can then verify that n869p538 is the user owner, a467p218_g is the group
owner and test access and file creation.
ls -ld /home/n869p538/directoryname





From the logs on castor, it appears you are running gem5 from the
/home/n519t593/power/. The ownership of the subfolders there is mixed between
root and your account, which could potentially cause permission denied errors
when you run it.

ls -l /home/n519t593/power/gem5-learning
drwxrwxr-x 6 n519t593 n519t593_g 4096 Nov 22 23:08 configs
drwxr-xr-x 14 root root 4096 Nov 22 20:38 gem5
drwxrwxr-x 4 n519t593 n519t593_g 4096 Nov 22 22:07 resources

When you change ownership of the /home/n519t593/power directory, try adding the
-R argument so that the ownership changes are recursive and apply to all
subfolders and files, making ownership consistent.

Eg:
sudo chown -R n519t593:a467p218_g /home/n519t593/power

See if this affects the permission denied error that you are getting. Please
let us know if you have further questions on this.

Thank you,
